## Basic

If you are creating a modal dialog, you probably want to use the [Dialog](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/feedback-dialog--api#dialog) component
rather than directly using Modal.

The component renders its children node in front of a backdrop component. The Modal offers important features:

- Manages modal stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.
- Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.
- It disables scrolling of the page content while open.
- It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content, and keeping it there until the modal is closed.
- Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically.

This component shares many concepts with [react-overlays](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/react-overlays/#modals).

###### Note. The term "modal" is sometimes used to mean "dialog", but this is a misnomer. A modal window describes parts of a UI. An element is considered modal if it blocks interaction with the rest of the application.
