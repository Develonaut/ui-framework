Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Dialogs
- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

## Contained Buttons

Contained buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

<Story story={Contained} />

<StoryAnchor name="Text" path={title} />

## Text Buttons

Text buttons are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located:

- In dialogs
- In cards

In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.

<Story story={Text} />

<StoryAnchor name="API" path={title} />

## API

#### Import

<ImportSnippet componentName={componentName} />

#### Playground

<Story story={API} name="API" expanded />

<ArgsTable Component={Button} name="API" />
