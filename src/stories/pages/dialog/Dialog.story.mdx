A Dialog is a type of [modal](?path=/docs/utils-modal--basic) window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

## Basic

Basic dialogs can provide additional details or actions about a list item. For example, they can display avatars, icons, clarifying subtext, or orthogonal actions (such as adding an account).

<Story story={Basic} path={title} />

## Sizes

You can set a dialog maximum width by using the `maxWidth` enumerable in combination with the `fullWidth` boolean. When the fullWidth property is true, the dialog will adapt based on the maxWidth value.

<Story story={Sizes} path={title} />
